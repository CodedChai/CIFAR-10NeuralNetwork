# CIFAR-10NeuralNetwork
Creating a Neural Network based on the CIFAR-10 Dataset

The dataset can be found at the below URL:
http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Per the website:
"The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class."


## Reference
This tech report (Chapter 3) describes the dataset and the methodology followed when collecting it in much greater detail. Please cite it if you intend to use this dataset.
